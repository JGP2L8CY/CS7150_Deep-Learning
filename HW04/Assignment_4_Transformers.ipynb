    "1. **Single Attention Head:**\n",
    "   - In a single attention head, we compute attention scores ($A_{ij}$) between every pair of input elements ($x_i$) and ($x_j$). These scores are computed using a compatibility function, often a dot product or a learned linear transformation followed by a softmax activation:\n",

    "The FeedForward Layer in the Transformer architecture is a position-wise neural network layer designed to process the context-aware representations generated by the self-attention mechanism. It consists of two linear transformations followed by a non-linear activation function, typically ReLU.  The FeedForward Layer is applied independently to each position in the sequence, allowing the model to capture different patterns at different positions. This position-wise independence, combined with non-linearity, helps the model learn complex relationships within the data and plays a crucial role in the Transformer's ability to process and understand sequential data effectively, making it a fundamental component for various sequence-to-sequence tasks.\n",

    "The decoder module in a Seq-Seq Transformer model is responsible for generating the output sequence based on the information gathered by the encoder and previous tokens in an autoregressive manner. It utilizes self-attention mechanisms with masking to enforce causality and multi-head attention to capture dependencies between tokens in the output. Self-attention calculates attention weights for each position in the sequence, and multi-head attention aggregates the results from multiple attention heads, enhancing the model's representational power. Cross-attention is also employed to allow the decoder to focus on relevant parts of the encoder's output.\n",

    "Additionally, position-wise feed-forward networks further process the information by applying linear transformations and non-linear activation functions to each position independently. Throughout the decoder, layer normalization and residual connections are utilized to enhance training stability. These components are typically stacked in multiple layers to enable the model to learn complex relationships and generate coherent output sequences.\n"
